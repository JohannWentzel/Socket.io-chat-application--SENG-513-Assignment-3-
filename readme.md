Socket.io Chat Application
==============

SENG 513 Assignment 3 - Johann Wentzel
--------------

This is a simple local chat application to demonstrate [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) in conjunction with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Assuming you already have Node.js installed, run the app in Node.js by navigating your terminal to the project directory and entering:
  `node index.js`

You can then show the app in a browser by navigating to
  `localhost:3000`
in any browser.

Special commands:
 - /nick - Change username
 - /nickcolor XXXXXX - Change the color of your username (six digit hex color eg. 0000FF).
